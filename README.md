# CourseMateApp

CourseMateApp is a mobile application for students to manage their courses and check their ranks during Game&App Academy.

The application is designed to allow students to track their grades, assignments, and schedules. It also includes features such as a to-do list, notifications, and the ability to add and drop courses.
The application is built using the Flutter framework, which is a popular open-source framework for developing mobile applications for both Android and iOS. The code in the repository includes various files and folders related to the application's user interface, data management, and functionality.
Briefly, CourseMateApp is a useful tool for students to stay organized and on top of their coursework.

In the future, we will add chat and group course work features to the CourseMateApp. These features could be a great way to enhance the application's functionality and usefulness for students. Here's a brief explanation of how these features could work:

Chat: This feature would allow students to communicate with each other in real-time, either one-on-one or in groups. It could be implemented using a messaging system within the app, where students can send text, images, or even audio messages to each other. This could be particularly useful for group projects or study sessions, where students need to collaborate and discuss ideas.

Group Course Work: This feature could enable students to work on projects or assignments together within the app. It could include tools for sharing documents, setting deadlines, assigning tasks, and tracking progress. This would be a great way to facilitate teamwork and encourage students to work together, even if they are not physically in the same location.

Overall, these features would make the "CourseMateApp" a more comprehensive tool for students to manage their coursework and collaborate with their peers.
